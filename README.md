# workRemix
Project idea: class gathers all their old work into communal "free resource" pile (physical and/or digital) -- proceed to make new work with only the old work as material; but anyone can use anyone elses work. 

## Remix.
Definition:

> To recombine (audio tracks or channels from a recording) to produce a new or modified audio recording. A variant of an original recording (as of a song) made by rearranging or adding to the original

Remixes in music allow for artists to develop or reveal their signature style. Imprinting one’s own flair onto an already known track shows off that artist’s sound and techniques. We want you to try the same thing with a piece of design. Please pick a peer's output from project 1 (any Counterfeit, Bootleg, or Appropriation outcome) and then rearrange and add in your own influences/goals/ideas to make something new. It will be easiest if you share all original source files with whomever asks you for your work.

A remix might alter a piece to make it better suit a new environment (dance club remix of a song, radio edit, etc…)

This project may be any medium; you may use any tools; you may use any additional content or ideas that you choose. 

This is a good opportunity to think about meaning making: how does a sign get its meaning? how to use new metaphors or different forms/knowledge domains to convey the same ideas; or to recontextualize the same initial visuals and grant them new meanings.

While audio mixing is the most recognized form of remixing, literature, film, art, technology, and social systems all have examples of “remix” within them.

## Getting Started.
- Ask students to collect work that they are okay getting rid of; destroying; seeing used by someone else.
- Collect everyone's work in one spot

q: 
- should we digitzie the materials? 
- do students work digitially? or do we want them to work physically?
- are copies permitted so that bits and pieces can be used more than once? if yes, should we premake some copies? can we have a copier available in the room?

generating a shared set of materials
they will be all digital
how do you work with this pile of stuff?

## What's next?

## What's the point?
This is what free culture looks like -- new work is always made from the old

McLuhan and the driving forward looking into the rear view mirror analogy? we use the old and the familiar to interpret the new? nah

What else needs to be pre-figured out?
