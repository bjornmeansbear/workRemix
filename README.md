# workRemix
Project idea: class gathers all their old work into communal "free resource" pile (physical and/or digital) -- proceed to make new work with only the old work as material; but anyone can use anyone elses work. 

## Remix.

## Getting Started.
- Ask students to collect work that they are okay getting rid of; destroying; seeing used by someone else.
- Collect everyone's work in one spot

q: 
- should we digitzie the materials? 
- do students work digitially? or do we want them to work physically?
- are copies permitted so that bits and pieces can be used more than once? if yes, should we premake some copies? can we have a copier available in the room?

## What's next?

## What's the point?
This is what free culture looks like -- new work is always made from the old

McLuhan and the driving forward looking into the rear view mirror analogy? we use the old and the familiar to interpret the new? nah

What else needs to be pre-figured out?

Reduce/Reuce/Recycle -- I had some good prompts for that project.
